# Manipulating Data Containers

Storing data sets in data frames is very convenient, but with just the indexing notation, can make for cumbersome tasks. 

Consider the following question (from UsingR): For the `normtemp` dataset perform a `t.test` for temperature by gender.

----

First, we load the data:

```{r}
require(UsingR)    # only for this dataset, don't bother installing
head(normtemp)
```

----

We see gender is coded. The docs (?normtemp) say 1 for male 2 for female:

```{r}
males <- normtemp[normtemp$gender == 1, "temperature"]
females <- normtemp[normtemp$gender == 2, "temperature"]
t.test(males, females)
```

----

The pain comes from having to type so much for a task which should be simple: split the data and apply some function.

For R's modeling functions, there is a syntax -- the  formula -- that is usually designed for this:

```{r}
t.test(temperature ~ gender, normtemp)
```

----

That's good for this function. But what about a lower level task: finding the mean or standard deviation of a group? There the model formula is not defined. It is helpful to develop some basic data massaging tools:

* subsetting (filtering) values
* reduction (selecting) variables to consider
* applying a function over a container
* grouping or splitting by values
* applying a function to groups of values

For these tasks we illustrate a few solutions, both with base R and with add-on packages.

## Exploring a data set

We will illustrate with two data sets, one modest, the other large

```{r}
library(nycflights13); library(MASS)
dim(flights)
dim(Cars93)
```

What do we have?

----

In RStudio, a data frame can be shown in a (non-editable) table. Typically these involves just clicking on their entry in then "Environment" tab. But as these come from built-in data sets, an extra step is needed to make them show up. The following looks silly, but it actually makes a copy in the current workspace:

```{r}
flights <- flights
Cars93 <- Cars93
```

---- 

Now double clicking will open up a window like

![flights-view](flights-view.png)

----

There are times where we still want summaries without a graphical view. Here we have:

```{r}
dim(flights)    # dimensions, also nrow, length
names(flights)   # also colnames
summary(flights)
```


## Subsetting, Filtering of vectors

What flights are JetBlue? We can see that the carrier variables is coded:

```{r}
table(flights$carrier)
```

---- 

Looking at the referenced `airlines` data set, we see that `B6` is JetBlue. How to get just those flights? There are several ways:

```{r}
jb <- flights[flights$carrier == "B6",]   # base indexing
jb <- with(flights, flights[carrier=="B6", ]) # using with
jb <- subset(flights, carrier == "B6")    # new function
```

The shortest -- by a hair -- is the use of `subset`. This is a convenience function. Rather than describe that function, we mention similar one from  the `dplyr` package.

## Subsetting, Filtering data frames using `dplyr`

The `dplyr` package provides some higher-level interfaces to indexing. For this task, filtering, we have the `filter` function.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

----

Here is `dplyr`'s alternative:

```{r}
jb <- filter(flights, carrier == "B6")
```

About the same, but we can make our queries much more involved:

```{r}
jb <- filter(flights, carrier == "B6", origin == "JFK")
```

Values get combined with `&`. To use "ors", we can use `|`:

```{r}
jb <- filter(flights, carrier == "B6" | origin == "JFK")
```


----

Some other examples. What flights went overnight?

Assuming the flights weren't 24 hours, these would be flights whose arrival time is less than the depature time:

```{r}
red_eyes <- filter(flights, dep_time > arr_time)
nrow(red_eyes) / nrow(flights)
```

What flights do not have a recorded air time?

```{r}
no_air <- filter(flights, is.na(flights$air_time))
dim(no_air)
```

Did any flights just turn around? (no)

```{r}
filter(flights, origin == dest)
```

## Reducing the number of variables

The `Cars93` data set has 27 variables. Suppose we only wanted to consider a selection of them. We can put in indices into the column position:

```{r}
a <- Cars93[, c(1, 2, 11, 12, 13,14)]
```

This can also use names for clarity:

```{r}
nms <- names(Cars93)[c(1, 2, 11, 12, 13,14)]  # or type ...
a <- Cars93[, nms]
```

If you want all *but* a variable, negative indexing is useful.

----

The `select` function of `dplyr` makes this slightly nicer if typing, as it use non-standard evaluation of names:

```{r}
a <- select(Cars93, Manufacturer, Model, Cylinders, EngineSize, Horsepower, RPM)
```

If can also "fill in", the above covers two sequences:

```{r}
a <- select(Cars93, Manufacturer:Model, Cylinders:RPM)
```


----

At the *enormous* risk of confusing things, the built-in `Filter` function can also be helpful with this task. This function (note capital "F") reduces the elements of a vector or list to just those that satisfy some condition.

An example would be a means to remove variables which are not numeric:

```{r}
x <-Filter(is.numeric, Cars93)   # Filter(predicate, data)
```

(lower case `filter` to filter rows, upper case to `Filter` columns)

## Combining operations. We can combine these tasks:

```{r}
a <- flights[flights$carrier == "B6", c("distance")]
```

The "piping" function in `dplyr` makes chaining distinct function calls pretty easy:

```{r}
a <- filter(flights, carrier == "B6") %>% select(distance)
```


## Applying a function over a container

Earlier we mentioned that R vectorizes function calls so that this:

```
[x1 x2 ... xn] -> [f(x1) f(x2) ... f(xn)]
```

is simply `f(x)`.

Can we do something similar for other containers? For example, lists?

```
[[ l1 l2 ... ln ]] -> [[ f(l1) f(l2) ... f(ln) ]]
```


----

The answer is "yes". 

In general this is called a "map". R has the `Map` function, but more commonly you'll see one of `sapply`, `lapply` or `apply`

The different names are because there are various means to apply a function over the rows or columns of a matrix or data frame and over components of a list.


## sapply

Say we have data in a data frame and we want to find the mean of each numeric column. We can do this in two steps:

* get just the numeric columns (`Filter`)
* apply the mean to each remaining one (`sapply`)

```{r}
x <- Filter(is.numeric, Cars93)     # Filter(function, data)
sapply(x, mean)                     # sapply(data, function)!!!
```

(How to get rid of the NA values?)

----

Earlier we saw that `summary` can be applied to data frames. This function also works for vectors. Calling it as follows is an alternative:

```{r}
sapply(flights, summary)
```


## Basics of functions

These are [higher-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) functions. We pass in the name of a function. Often these are already defined for us, but there are times where we would want to define our own. For example, one way to remove NA values before computing the mean is to set the argument `na.rm=TRUE`. It is false by default. We could do this:

```{r}
our_mean <- function(x) mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Then we can use:

```{r}
sapply(Filter(is.numeric, Cars93),   our_mean)
```

----

This task of setting an argument to a function is common enough that `sapply` permits passing these as additional arguments, so more idiomatically we would have:

```
sapply(Filter(is.numeric, Cars93),  mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```

But being able to define quick functions is very useful.

## Functions: basic

Without diving in too deeply, the basic template for a *simple* function is just:

```
fn_name <- function(x) {
   ... do something with x ....
   ... last value evaluated is the value returned ...
}
```

In our previous example, we only have one command we do so braces were optional.


## anonymous functions

If you want to reduce typing, we can even define function "anonymously":

```
sapply(Filter(is.numeric, Cars93), function(x) mean(x, na.rm=TRUE))
```

That double composition gets to be too much to read, but is not so hard to type when needed.


## splitting or grouping

We return to the motivating example: splitting and then applying some function.

First, splitting. Base R has the command `split` that can be used to create a list of groups defined by some factor. For example, the `Cars93` data set has the `Origin` factor:

```{r}
by_origin <- split(Cars93, Cars93$Origin)
```

The `by_origin` variable is a list with two components: one for `USA` and one `non-USA`. If we wanted we could apply a function to teach. 

----

For example, here is *one* way to get the number of cases in each:

```{r}
sapply(by_origin, nrow)
```

(Maybe `table(Cars93$Origin)` is more direct.)

----

To get the average mileage for each requires a function which takes a data frame and returns th average. For that there is nothing built-in, so we roll our own:

```{r}
sapply(by_origin, function(d) mean(d$MPG.highway))
```

---- 

We can see the total distance each airplane (unique tail numbers) flew with the following:

```{r}
out <- split(flights, flights$tailnum) %>%
  sapply(function(d) sum(d$distance, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
    sort(decreasing=TRUE) %>% head(n=5)
out
```

---- 

What do we know about the airlines that worked these planes so hard?

```{r}
with(flights, flights[tailnum == names(out)[-1], "carrier"]) %>%
  unique
```

They were all American. (Why a data frame print ou?)

----

Hmm, interesting. Can we get the distance traveled by carrier?

```{r}
out <- split(flights, flights$carrier) %>% 
  sapply(function(d) sum(d$distance, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
           sort(decreasing=TRUE) %>% head(n=5)
out
```

---- 

And these are

```{r}
filter(airlines, carrier %in% names(out))
```

## group_by

The `dplyr` package provides `group_by` which makes some of these tasks a bit more straightforward. The `group_by` function does the splitting:

```{r}
group_by(flights, carrier)   # no need to qualify `carrier`
```
----

We can then chain things:

```{r}
out = group_by(flights, carrier) %>%   # no need to qualify `carrier`
  summarize(dist = sum(distance)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(dist)) %>% head(n=5)
out
```  

----

Not sure this is more clear or less. We see the use of `summarize`, `arrange` and `head`. 

The  `arrange` function plays the role of sort, but `arrange` is working on a data frame and `sort` on a vector.

----

The `summarize` function makes it easy to apply a reduction to groups. For example, to find the mean and standard deviation of distance for each carrier would be done with:

```{r}
group_by(flights, carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean=mean(distance), sd=sd(distance)) %>%
     arrange(desc(mean)) %>% head
```        

(What is a 0 sd?)
